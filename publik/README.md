#Pinnacle Health

Pinnacle Health is an application to improve the documentation process of health care provider’s electronic medical records.

Giving health care providers a standardized format to assess a patients full spectrum of needs from all of their health care providers.

Pinnacle health gives the user access to one of the most secure data structures available by utilizing BlockStack.

By providing users the opportunity to populate their medical data with their practitioner’s diagnosis and treatments, User’s have full control of their own records while simultaneously standardizing the data their practitioners are producing.

This can help improve doctors’ abilities to diagnose patients correctly as well as speed up care and reduce time-consuming, costly, and redundant testing. With 12 million American misdiagnosed each year, having standardized electronic health records can also help whole populations by allowing patients and doctors access to data on every disease and how other patients were successfully treated.
